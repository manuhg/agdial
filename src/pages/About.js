  about: (
    <span>
      <p>
        Shramajeevi Agri Films was established in 2004 as an exclusive visual media production house for agriculture. It
        had produced number of agricultural documentary films in Kannada, English and Hindi. These were sold in the form
        of DVDs in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Shramajeevi produced number of AVs for government departments,
        research organisations and corporate companies. Now Shramajeevi documentaries are available for watching on its
        YouTube channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shramajeevi launched many websites for different issues related to farming. Shramajeevi is becoming 24x7
        satellite TV channel in Kannada exclusive for agriculture very soon, under the banner of Shramajeevi Television
        Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farmers from across the country and globe keep calling Shramajeevi for various contacts of innovative farmers,
        institutes etc. So,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://shramajeevicontacts.com">shramajeevicontacts.com</a>, a service website with good number of
        contacts was launched in the year 2015. The feedback was very good and it helped thousands of farmers. Then it
        was decided to bring out the business version of the same now as <a href="https://agdial.in">agdial.in</a> in
        more systematic and extensive way. Call and SMS facility and many more features will be added at later stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know it is a huge, extensive and expensive task as the sector is highly unorganised and scattered domain. We
        will exercise our sincere efforts in the days to come to bring all stakeholders of farming on this website. We
        plan to get in to E commerce exclusive for agriculture in the brand name AgTrade{' '}
        <a href="https://agtrade.in">agtrade.in</a> in 2nd phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin with AgDial is focussing on Karnataka state and it will cover the whole country in later stage. AgDial
        will be absolutely free for users. We hope this communication platform will enhance connectivity between various
        stakeholders of farming bringing a positive change in the farming sector of India.
